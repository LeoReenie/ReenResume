                <h4> Since I was a child in my 11th years, I was actually interested in becoming stewardess. The mainly
                    reason would be because of their beauty. I'm interested with beauty and fashion. Hence, it is normal 
                    for me to even have a thought about that. Until I realized that I actually want to have a normal office
                    hour working job. As long as I get to see my family often as me myself is a family person. However, 
                    I'm still not sure on which career path I should take to become an office worker.

                <h4>
                    When I'm in my 16th years, I took Science Computer, Business and Economy as my elective. Out of all this
                    elective. I'm more interested in Business rather than Science Computer. So this two elective subject required
                    us as a students to complete our Kerja Kursus. For Science Computer, it is natural for us to built a website
                    from scratch. At first it was difficult for me as I didnt even understand on how it works until my friends 
                    teach me.
                </h4>
                <br>
                <h4>
                    Thanks to my friends who teach and lead me during my journey in completing the website. I was then able to 
                    opened my eyes bigger in understanding HTML or coding. Not only that, but I'm able to complete the Kerja Kursus
                    with fun memories and new knowledge. By completing this led me to choose career path related to Science Computer.
                    But here is the things, I'm not very fond with Mathematics and to take Diploma of Science Computer, individuals 
                    must score credit in their Mathematics grade.

                <h4>
                    Until I was introduced to Diploma of Information Management, UiTM by my senior. She said that I should join this 
                    diploma because it is related with theories yet learn coding. It excites me after hearing that I immediately aimed
                    Diploma of Information Management as my first choice in applying UPU. Alhamdulillah, I got my first choice and here 
                    I'm in my last semester in this course. Out of all classes, I am definitely excited and have fun when learning coding.
